This project showcases a house built using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to describe how HTML elements are displayed on different media,
such as screens and paper.

Overview:

The CSS House project aims to demonstrate the power and flexibility of CSS in controlling the layout and design of web pages. 
By utilizing an external stylesheet, the styling rules for the house are stored in a separate CSS file, promoting modularity and reusability.


happy coding .......
